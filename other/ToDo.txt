Things that could be done to improve app:

* Make it such that when another location is added/removed, line colors for remaining stay the same (e.g. assign fixed color to each location based on row entry or similar, not based on relative order among selected locations).
* add data source to tooltip
* any further plot/legend improvements for better readability

* Implement a 3rd tab that lets users look at counties for a selected state (cases/hosp/death only and only data sources that report county level info).

* Update x-axis button/slider so we can either specify at which calendar day or which N to start
* Rewrite code such that all data is stored in long format, with a column for variable name and one for value, instead of the current setup where each different variable (e.g. Daily_Deaths, Total_Cases) has its own column.
* further streamline code
