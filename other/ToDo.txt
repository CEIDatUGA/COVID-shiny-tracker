Things that could be done to improve app:

* Add ourworld in data source for world tab: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data
* Update x-axis button/slider so we can either specify at which calendar day or which N to start
* add data source to tooltip
* add trend-lines and 1 and/or 2-week predictions based on simple smoothing/extrapolation
* change the 'data source' option to be like the state selector, which allows users to choose any source they want.
* further streamline code
