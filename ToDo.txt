Things that could be done to improve app:

* further streamline code
* add trend-lines and 1/2-week predictions based on simple smoothing/extrapolation
* Add ourworld in data source: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data
* Update x-axis button/slider so we can either specify at which calendar day or which N to start
* add data source to tooltip
